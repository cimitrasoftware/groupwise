GroupWise Admin Helpdesk Scripts by Cimitra
Version: 1.4

Author: Tay Kratzer tay@cimitra.com

Special thanks to Eliot Lloyd Lanes and Viable Solutions Inc. for hosting the GroupWise system where we I created these scripts. â€‹

Testing Info: These scripts have been tested on **SLES12 and GroupWise 18**

Documentation and introduction at https://cimitra.com/gw

**Installation and Configuration is just 2 easy steps!**

**1.** **DOWNLOAD AND RUN** the GroupWise Admin Helpdesk Scripts by Cimitra **install** script file on a GroupWise server on Linux

**curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cimitrasoftware/groupwise/master/install -o ./ ; chmod +x ./install ; ./install**

UNIVERSAL SETTINGS FILE (settings_gw.cfg)
All of these scripts are designed to read configuration settings from a file called **settings_gw.cfg**. The settings_gw.cfg file should be automatically generated if it does not exist. When you run a script, with the properly configured command line variables, if the settings_gw.cfg file does not exist, the script will create it. If you are having troubles getting a settings_gw.cfg file just run the script: gw_system_list_users.sh and the file should get automatically created. 

UNIVERSAL HELP
To get the help for a script, just run the script, or run it with a -h switch and you will get a help screen. 

**2.** **CONFIGURE** GWADMIN-SERVICE LOCATION AND CREDENTIALS IN **THE SETTINGS FILE (settings_gw.cfg)**

By default the (settings_gw.cfg) is in the following directory:

**/var/opt/cimitra/scripts/grouwpise-master/helpdesk/settings_gw.cfg**

Edit the settings_gw.cfg file and make sure **GW_ADMIN*** variables are all properly configured. Similar to this. 

GW_ADMIN_SERVICE_ADDRESS="192.168.1.2"

GW_ADMIN_SERVICE_PORT="9710"

GW_ADMIN_USER="Cimitra"

GW_ADMIN_PASSWORD="isCool"

**EXCLUDE GROUPS** ( A really cool feature, read on my friends! )
All scripts that modify or read user objects have a built in "exclude" function. Namely, you can make it so that certain users are excluded from being affected or viewed with these scripts. You can either user the exclude_gw.cfg file or an "exclude group" in GroupWise. 

STEP **1.** TO MAKE AND "EXCLUDE GROUP"
Make a new group in GroupWise, give it a name of your choosing.

STEP **2.** ADD USERS TO THE "EXCLUDE GROUP"
Add users to that group that you do not want the scripts to be able to modify or view etc. So for example, if you were to share these scripts with Help Desk personnel via Cimitra, but you wanted to make sure that the Help Desk personnel couldn't modify your account, and other admins etc. then you would add yourself and others to that the group you made for handling exclusions. 

STEP **3.** MODIFY THE settings_gw.cfg FILE
Edit the settings_gw.cfg file and define the following fields specific to the exclude group you created. If I called the GroupWise Group HELP_DESK_CANNOT_ADMINISTER then my settings_gw.cfg file would look something like this: 

GW_EXCLUDE_GROUP_ENABLED="1"

GW_EXCLUDE_GROUP_NAME="HELP_DESK_CANNOT_ADMINISTER"

GW_EXCLUDE_GROUP_POST_OFFICE_NAME="PO1"

GW_EXCLUDE_GROUP_DOMAIN_NAME="DOMAIN1"

**USER QUICKFINDER INDEX REBUILD SCRIPT**
One of the scripts, gw_user_quickfinder.sh can rebuild a user's QuickFinder index files. This script needs information about the POA's HTTP console. Run the script with the appropriate input information and it will make additional changes to the settings_gw.cfg file for you to configure. 

**UPGRADING/UPDATING**
The GroupWise Admin Helpdesk Scripts by Cimitra ships with a script specifically for upgrading to the latest version of these scripts. The update script will be in the directory where you installed the software in the "groupwise-master" directory. For most installations this will be: **/var/opt/cimitra/scripts/groupwise-master** 

The script is simply called: **update**

**Enjoy**
